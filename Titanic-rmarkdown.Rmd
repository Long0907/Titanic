# Luqing will work on the logistic regression part.
## __Use machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck__

# We first started with a simple logistic regression to predict survial, and will compare the results from this to a more advanced machine learning model. 

#required packages
```{r, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

#load the dataset and explore.
```{r}
train<- read_csv("dataset/train.csv")
#get an overview of the data
train %>% 
  skimr::skim()
#drop cabin column, because of too many missing data 687/891. 
train <- train[!colnames(train)=='Cabin']


```
